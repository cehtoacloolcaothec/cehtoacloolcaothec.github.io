                <p> "&nbsp&nbspHi, killer. I don't think someone will read this, except you. I couldn't care less.
                    That night, oh that night. It was nice, right? We were having fun, even though I met you just a few weeks ago. It started nice, when you offered to help me when 
                    I was carrying groceries, when you offered some sweet <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="0" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span>; 
                    even the flowers were nice!
                </p>
                <p>
                        &nbsp&nbspI liked you. Your smell was relaxing, your <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="1" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span> always 
                    looked good. Your eyes, they were deep. Maybe too deep.
                </p>
                <p>
                        &nbsp&nbspSomething was <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="2" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span>, and I knew it. I knew it all along, 
                    it was just that I couldn't see it that well. You didn't want me. You wanted my 
                    <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="3" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span>, not who I was.
                </p>
                <p>
                        &nbsp&nbspThat night, when we finished our <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="4" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span>, you asked to take me 
                    <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="5" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span>. I refused, kindly, because I already told you that I had to 
                    help my <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="6" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span> with her bakery, to store some products. 
                    That made you angry. The fact that I wasn't yours, that I could be apart from you. The way your hands 
                    clutched against my arm, the way you looked at me as if I had betrayed you. You lost yourself, and I also lost you. This... thing, I didn't recognize 
                    you, it scared me, so I tried to escape from you. I guess that was wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                        &nbsp&nbspWhen I finally got away from you, I felt free, but not safe. I felt like the danger was not over and it was then, that you realized I was useless to you. 
                    When I could't see the beauty, the charm, the charisma.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp&nbspAll I saw, was a monster. You shot me through the <span class="input-group puzzle-input"><input id="7" type="text" class="form-control first-puzzle-input" maxlength="7" placeholder=""></span>. 
                    I bled, and cried. But I also died. Thanks to god I was never yours, and I hope no one will.</p>
